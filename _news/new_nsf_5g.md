We are excited to announce the beginning of a new [NSF project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925079&HistoricalAwards=false) with [Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg), [Sundeep Rangan](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/sundeep-rangan) and [Elza Erkip](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/elza-erkip) entitled “Action-perception loops over 5G millimeter wave wireless for cooperative manipulation” within the National Robotics Initiative Program. The project will investigate how 5G wireless communication can be used to offload computation-heavy action-perception loops to the cloud while ensuring robust and safe performance.
