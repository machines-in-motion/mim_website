We are excited to announce the beginning of a new [NSF project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1932187&HistoricalAwards=false) with [Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng) and [Maurizio Porfiri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/maurizio-porfiri) entitled “Accurate and Efficient Collective Additive Manufacturing by Mobile Robots” within the Cyber-Physical Systems Program. The project will investigate how we can use mobile robots to 3D print concrete structures.
