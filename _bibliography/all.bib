 abstract={Designed and evolved self-replicating structures in cellular automata have been extensively studied in the past as models of Artificial Life. However, CAs, unlike their biological counterpart, are very brittle: any faulty cell usually leads to the complete destruction of any emerging structures, let alone self-replicating structures. A way to design fault-tolerant structures based on error-correcting-code has been presented recently [1], but it required a cumbersome work to be put into practice. In this paper, we get back to the original inspiration for these works, nature, and propose a way to evolve self-replicating structures, faults here being only an idiosyncracy of the environment.},

 abstract={Nonlinear oscillators are widely used in biology, physics and engineering for modeling and control. They are interesting because of their synchronization properties when coupled to other dynamical systems. In this paper, we propose a learning rule for oscillators which adapts their frequency to the frequency of any periodic or pseudo-periodic input signal. Learning is done in a dynamic way: it is part of the dynamical system and not an offline process. An interesting property of our model is that it is easily generalizable to a large class of oscillators, from phase oscillators to relaxation oscillators and strange attractors with a generic learning rule. One major feature of our learning rule is that the oscillators constructed can adapt their frequency without any signal processing or the need to specify a time window or similar free parameters. All the processing is embedded in the dynamics of the adaptive oscillator. The convergence of the learning is proved for the Hopf oscillator, then numerical experiments are carried out to explore the learning capabilities of the system. Finally, we generalize the learning rule to non-harmonic oscillators like relaxation oscillators and strange attractors.},

 DOI={10.1109/ROBOT.2006.1641933}, 
 abstract={We present a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators to be used as programmable central pattern generators, and apply it to control the locomotion of a humanoid robot. Central pattern generators are biological neural networks that can produce coordinated multidimensional rhythmic signals, under the control of simple input signals. They are found both in vertebrate and invertebrate animals for the control of locomotion. In this article, we present a novel system composed of coupled adaptive nonlinear oscillators that can learn arbitrary rhythmic signals in a supervised learning framework. Using adaptive rules implemented as differential equations, parameters such as intrinsic frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling weights are automatically adjusted to replicate a teaching signal. Once the teaching signal is removed, the trajectories remain embedded as the limit cycle of the dynamical system. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the learning is completely embedded into the dynamical system, and does not require external optimization algorithms. We use our system to encapsulate rhythmic trajectories for biped locomotion with a simulated humanoid robot, and demonstrate how it can be used to do online trajectory generation. The system can modulate the speed of locomotion, and even allow the reversal of direction (i.e. walking backwards). The integration of sensory feedback allows the online modulation of trajectories such as to increase the basin of stability of the gaits, and therefore the range of speeds that can be produced},

 abstract={Periodic behavior is key to life and is observed in multiple instances and at multiple time scales in our metabolism, our natural environment, and our engineered environment. A natural way of modeling or generating periodic behavior is done by using oscillators, i.e., dynamical systems that exhibit limit cycle behavior. While there is extensive literature on methods to analyze such dynamical systems, much less work has been done on methods to synthesize an oscillator to exhibit some specific desired characteristics. The goal of this article is twofold: (1) to provide a framework for characterizing and designing oscillators and (2) to review how classes of well-known oscillators can be understood and related to this framework. The basis of the framework is to characterize oscillators in terms of their fundamental temporal and spatial behavior and in terms of properties that these two behaviors can be designed to exhibit. This focus on fundamental properties is important because it allows us to systematically compare a large variety of oscillators that might at first sight appear very different from each other. We identify several specifications that are useful for design, such as frequency-locking behavior, phase-locking behavior, and specific output signal shape. We also identify two classes of design methods by which these specifications can be met, namely offline methods and online methods. By relating these specifications to our framework and by presenting several examples of how oscillators have been designed in the literature, this article provides a useful methodology and toolbox for designing oscillators for a wide range of purposes. In particular, the focus on synthesis of limit cycle dynamical systems should be useful both for engineering and for computational modeling of physical or biological phenomena.},

 abstract={Locomotion on an irregular surface is a challenging task in robotics. Among different problems to solve to obtain robust locomotion, visually guided locomotion and accurate foot placement are of crucial importance. Robust controllers able to adapt to sensory-motor feedbacks, in particular to properly place feet on specific locations, are thus needed. Dynamical systems are well suited for this task as any online modification of the parameters leads to a smooth adaptation of the trajectories, allowing a safe integration of sensory-motor feedback. In this contribution, as a first step in the direction of locomotion on irregular surfaces, we present a controller that allows hand placement during crawling in a simulated humanoid robot. The goal of the controller is to superimpose rhythmic movements for crawling with discrete (i.e. short-term) modulations of the hand placements to reach specific marks on the ground.},

Biological CPGs are neural networks responsible for the generation of rhythmic movements, especially locomotion. In robotics, a systematic way of designing such CPGs as artificial neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators with sensory feedback inclusion is still missing. In this contribution, we present a way of designing CPGs with coupled oscillators in which we can independently control the ascending and descending phases of the oscillations (i.e. the swing and stance phases of the limbs). Using insights from dynamical system theory, we construct generic networks of oscillators able to generate several gaits under simple parameter changes. Then we introduce a systematic way of adding sensory feedback from touch sensors in the CPG such that the controller is strongly coupled with the mechanical system it controls. Finally we control three different simulated robots (iCub, Aibo and Ghostdog) using the same controller to show the effectiveness of the approach. Our simulations prove the importance of independent control of swing and stance duration. The strong mutual coupling between the CPG and the robot allows for more robust locomotion, even under non precise parameters and non-flat environment.},

The frequency spectrum of the signal is reflected in the statistics of the intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators. The frequency analysis is completely embedded in the dynamics of the system. Thus, no pre-processing or additional parameters, such as time windows, are needed. Representative results of the numerical integration of the system are presented. It is shown, that the oscillators tune to the correct frequencies for both discrete and continuous spectra. Due to its dynamic nature the system is also capable to track non-stationary spectra. Further, we show that the system can be modeled in a probabilistic manner by means of a nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation. The probabilistic treatment is in good agreement with the numerical results, and provides a useful tool to understand the underlying mechanisms leading to convergence.},

We develop an experimental test bench to measure quantitatively the performance of different controllers on unknown terrains of increasing difficulty. First, we show that for flat terrains, open loop limit cycle systems are the most efficient (in terms of speed of locomotion) but that they are quite sensitive to environmental changes. Second, we show that sensory feedback is a crucial addition for unknown terrains. Third, we show that the chaotic controller with sensory feedback outperforms the other controllers in very difficult terrains and actually promotes the emergence of short synchronized movement patterns. All that is done using an unified framework for the generation of limit cycle and chaotic behaviors, where a simple parameter change can switch from one behavior to the other through bifurcation. Such flexibility would allow the automatic adaptation of the robot locomotion strategy to the terrain uncertainty.},

 abstract={Legged robots have gained an increased attention these past decades since they offer a promising technology for many applications in unstructured environments where the use of wheeled robots is clearly limited. Such applications include exploration and rescue tasks where human intervention is difficult (e.g. after a natural disaster) or impossible (e.g. on radioactive sites) and the emerging domain of assistive robotics where robots should be able to meaningfully and efficiently interact with humans in their environment (e.g. climbing stairs). Moreover the technology developed for walking machines can help designing new rehabilitation devices for disabled persons such as active prostheses. However the control of agile legged locomotion is a challenging problem that is not yet solved in a satisfactory manner. By taking inspiration from the neural control of locomotion in animals, we develop in this thesis controllers for legged locomotion. These controllers are based on the concept of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), which are neural networks located in the spine of vertebrates that generate the rhythmic patterns that control locomotion. The use of a strong mathematical framework, namely dynamical systems theory, allows one to build general design methodologies for such controllers. The original contributions of this thesis are organized along three main axes. The first one is a work on biological locomotion and more specifically on crawling human infants. Comparisons of the detailed kinematics and gait pattern of crawling infants with those of other quadruped mammals show many similarities. This is quite surprising since infant morphology is not well suited for quadruped locomotion. In a second part, we use some of these findings as an inspiration for the design of our locomotion controllers. We try to provide a systematic design methodology for CPGs. Specifically we design an oscillator to independently control the swing and stance durations during locomotion, then using insights from dynamical systems theory we construct generic networks supporting different gaits and finally we integrate sensory feedback in the system. Experiments on three different simulated quadruped robots show the effectiveness of the approach. The third axis of research focus on dynamical systems theory and more specifically on the development of an adaptive mechanism for oscillators such that they can learn the frequency of any periodic signal. Interestingly this mechanism is generic enough to work with a large class of oscillators. Extensive mathematical analysis are provided in order to understand the fundamental properties of this mechanism. Then an extension to pools of adaptive frequency oscillators with a negative feedback loop is used to build programmable CPGs (i.e. CPGs that can encode any periodic pattern as a structurally stable limit cycle). We use the system to control the locomotion of a humanoid robot. We also show applications of this system to signal processing.},

Interestingly, this mechanism can easily be applied to a large class of oscillators from harmonic oscillators to relaxation types and strange attractors. Several practical applications of this mechanism are then presented, ranging from adaptive control of compliant robots to frequency analysis of signals and construction of limit cycles of arbitrary shape.},

 abstract={Energy-shaping control methods have produced strong theoretical results for asymptotically stable 3D bipedal dynamic walking in the literature. In particular, geometric controlled reduction exploits robot symmetries to control momentum conservation laws that decouple the sagittal-plane dynamics, which are easier to stabilize. However, the associated control laws require high-dimensional matrix inverses multiplied with complicated energy-shaping terms, often making these control theories difficult to apply to highly-redundant humanoid robots. This paper presents a first step towards the application of energy-shaping methods on real robots by casting controlled reduction into a framework of constrained accelerations for inverse dynamics control. By representing momentum conservation laws as constraints in acceleration space, we construct a general expression for desired joint accelerations that render the constraint surface invariant. By appropriately choosing an orthogonal projection, we show that the unconstrained (reduced) dynamics are decoupled from the constrained dynamics. Any acceleration-based controller can then be used to stabilize this planar subsystem, including passivity-based methods. The resulting control law is surprisingly simple and represents a practical way to employ control theoretic stability results in robotic platforms. Simulated walking of a 3D compass-gait biped show correspondence between the new and original controllers, and simulated motions of a 16-DOF humanoid demonstrate the applicability of this method.},

 abstract={Contact interaction with the environment is crucial in the design of locomotion controllers for legged robots, to prevent slipping for example. Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to control the effects of the robots movements on the contact reaction forces. In this contribution, we extend a recent inverse dynamics algorithm for floating base robots to optimize the distribution of contact forces while achieving precise trajectory tracking. The resulting controller is algorithmically simple as compared to other approaches. Numerical simulations show that this result significantly increases the range of possible movements of a humanoid robot as compared to the previous inverse dynamics algorithm. We also present a simplification of the result where no inversion of the inertia matrix is needed which is particularly relevant for practical use on a real robot. Such an algorithm becomes interesting for agile locomotion of robots on difficult terrains where the contacts with the environment are critical, such as walking over rough or slippery terrain.},

 abstract={Inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers have proved to be very efficient for compliant control of fully actuated robots such as fixed base manipulators. However legged robots such as humanoids are inherently different as they are underactuated and subject to switching external contact constraints. Recently several methods have been proposed to create inverse dynamics controllers and operational space controllers for these robots. In an attempt to compare these different approaches, we develop a general framework for inverse dynamics control and show that these methods lead to very similar controllers. We are then able to greatly simplify recent whole-body controllers based on operational space approaches using kinematic projections, bringing them closer to efficient practical implementations. We also generalize these controllers such that they can be optimal under an arbitrary quadratic cost in the commands.},

 abstract={The development of agile and safe humanoid robots require controllers that guarantee both high tracking performance and compliance with the environment. More specifically, the control of contact interaction is of crucial importance for robots that will actively interact with their environment. Model-based controllers such as inverse dynamics or operational space control are very appealing as they offer both high tracking performance and compliance. However, while widely used for fully actuated systems such as manipulators, they are not yet standard controllers for legged robots such as humanoids. Indeed such robots are fundamentally different from manipulators as they are underactuated due to their floating-base and subject to switching contact constraints. In this paper we present an inverse dynamics controller for legged robots that use torque redundancy to create an optimal distribution of contact constraints. The resulting controller is able to minimize, given a desired motion, any quadratic cost of the contact constraints at each instant of time. In particular we show how this can be used to minimize tangential forces during locomotion, therefore significantly improving the locomotion of legged robots on difficult terrains. In addition to the theoretical result, we present simulations of a humanoid and a quadruped robot, as well as experiments on a real quadruped robot that demonstrate the advantages of the controller.},

 abstract={The operational space formulation (Khatib, 1987), applied to rigid-body manipulators, describes how to decouple task-space and null-space dynamics, and write control equations that correspond only to forces at the end-effector or, alternatively, only to motion within the null-space. We would like to apply this useful theory to modern humanoids and other legged systems, for manipulation or similar tasks, however these systems present additional challenges due to their underactuated floating bases and contact states that can dynamically change. In recent work, Sentis et al. derived controllers for such systems by implementing a task Jacobian projected into a space consistent with the supporting constraints and underactuation (the so called “support consistent reduced Jacobian”). Here, we take a new approach to derive operational space controllers for constrained underactuated systems, by first considering the operational space dynamics within “projected inverse-dynamics” (Aghili, 2005), and subsequently resolving underactuation through the addition of dynamically consistent control torques. Doing so results in a simplified control solution compared with previous results, and importantly yields several new insights into the underlying problem of operational space control in constrained environments: 1) Underactuated systems, such as humanoid robots, cannot in general completely decouple task and null-space dynamics. However, 2) there may exist an infinite number of control solutions to realize desired task-space dynamics, and 3) these solutions involve the addition of dynamically consistent null-space motion or constraint forces (or combinations of both). In light of these findings, we present several possible control solutions, with varying optimization criteria, and highlight some of their practical consequences.},

 abstract={Developing robots capable of fine manipulation skills is of major importance in order to build truly assistive robots. These robots need to be compliant in their actuation and control in order to operate safely in human environments. Manipulation tasks imply complex contact interactions with the external world, and involve reasoning about the forces and torques to be applied. Planning under contact conditions is usually impractical due to computational complexity, and a lack of precise dynamics models of the environment. We present an approach to acquiring manipulation skills on compliant robots through reinforcement learning. The initial position control policy for manipulation is initialized through kinesthetic demonstration. We augment this policy with a force/torque profile to be controlled in combination with the position trajectories. We use the Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) algorithm to learn these force/torque profiles by optimizing a cost function that measures task success. We demonstrate our approach on the Barrett WAM robot arm equipped with a 6-DOF force/torque sensor on two different manipulation tasks: opening a door with a lever door handle, and picking up a pen off the table. We show that the learnt force control policies allow successful, robust execution of the tasks.},

In uncertain and highly dynamic environments such as human households, robots need to be able to instantly adapt their behavior to unforseen events. In this paper, we propose a general framework to achieve very contact-reactive motions for robotic grasping and manipulation. Associating stereotypical movements to particular tasks enables our system to use previous sensor experiences as a predictive model for subsequent task executions. We use dynamical systems, named Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), to learn goal-directed behaviors from demonstration. We exploit their dynamic properties by coupling them with the measured and predicted sensor traces. This feedback loop allows for online adaptation of the movement plan. Our system can create a rich set of possible motions that account for external perturbations and perception uncertainty to generate truly robust behaviors.

 abstract={Applying model-free reinforcement learning to manipulation remains challenging for several reasons. First, manipulation involves physical contact, which causes discontinuous cost functions. Second, in manipulation, the end-point of the movement must be chosen carefully, as it represents a grasp which must be adapted to the pose and shape of the object. Finally, there is uncertainty in the object pose, and even the most carefully planned movement may fail if the object is not at the expected position. To address these challenges we 1) present a simplified, computationally more efficient version of our model-free reinforcement learning algorithm PI2; 2) extend PI2 so that it simultaneously learns shape parameters and goal parameters of motion primitives; 3) use shape and goal learning to acquire motion primitives that are robust to object pose uncertainty.

 abstract={Vertebrates are able to quickly adapt to new environments in a very robust, seemingly effortless way. To explain both this adaptivity and robustness, a very promising perspective in neurosciences is the modular approach to movement generation: Movements results from combinations of a finite set of stable motor primitives organized at the spinal level. In this article we apply this concept of modular generation of movements to the control of robots with a high number of degrees of freedom, an issue that is challenging notably because planning complex, multidimensional trajectories in time-varying environments is a laborious and costly process. We thus propose to decrease the complexity of the planning phase through the use of a combination of discrete and rhythmic motor primitives, leading to the decoupling of the planning phase (i.e. the choice of behavior) and the actual trajectory generation. Such implementation eases the control of, and the switch between, different behaviors by reducing the dimensionality of the high-level commands. Moreover, since the motor primitives are generated by dynamical systems, the trajectories can be smoothly modulated, either by high-level commands to change the current behavior or by sensory feedback information to adapt to environmental constraints. In order to show the generality of our approach, we apply the framework to interactive drumming and infant crawling in a humanoid robot. These experiments illustrate the simplicity of the control architecture in terms of planning, the integration of different types of feedback (vision and contact) and the capacity of autonomously switching between different behaviors (crawling and simple reaching).},

 abstract={The ability to grasp unknown objects is an important skill for personal robots, which has been addressed by many present and past research projects, but still remains an open problem. A crucial aspect of grasping is choosing an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e. the 6d pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. Finding feasible grasp configurations for novel objects, however, is challenging because of the huge variety in shape and size of these objects. Moreover, possible configurations also depend on the specific kinematics of the robotic arm and hand in use. In this paper, we introduce a new grasp selection algorithm able to find object grasp poses based on previously demonstrated grasps. Assuming that objects with similar shapes can be grasped in a similar way, we associate to each demonstrated grasp a grasp template. The template is a local shape descriptor for a possible grasp pose and is constructed using 3d information from depth sensors. For each new object to grasp, the algorithm then finds the best grasp candidate in the library of templates. The grasp selection is also able to improve over time using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates. We tested the algorithm on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM arm which have very different hands. Our results show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does indeed improve its performance over time.},

Furthermore we do not only consider observations of the object, but we also take space into account which has been observed to not be part of the object. Furthermore we are computing a posterior distribution over the relative alignment and not a point estimate as typically done in for example Iterative Closest Point (ICP). To our knowledge no existing algorithm meets these three conditions and we thus derive a novel registration algorithm in a Bayesian framework.

 abstract={Movement primitives as basis of movement planning and control have become a popular topic in recent years. The key idea of movement primitives is that a rather small set of stereotypical movements should suffice to create a large set of complex manipulation skills. An interesting side effect of stereotypical movement is that it also creates stereotypical sensory events, e.g., in terms of kinesthetic variables, haptic variables, or, if processed appropriately, visual variables. Thus, a movement primitive executed towards a particular object in the environment will associate a large number of sensory variables that are typical for this manipulation skill. These association can be used to increase robustness towards perturbations, and they also allow failure detection and switching towards other behaviors. We call such movement primitives augmented with sensory associations Associative Skill Memories (ASM). This paper addresses how ASMs can be acquired by imitation learning and how they can create robust manipulation skill by determining subsequent ASMs online to achieve a particular manipulation goal. Evaluation for grasping and manipulation with a Barrett WAM/Hand illustrate our approach.},

The originality of our approach resides in the formulation of the problem as a quadratic program where we only need to solve for the control commands and where the contact forces are optimized implicitly. Furthermore, we do not need a structured representation of the dynamics of the robot (i.e. an explicit computation of the inertia matrix). It is in contrast with existing methods based on quadratic programs. The controller is then robust to uncertainty in the estimation of the dynamics model and the optimization is fast enough to be implemented in high bandwidth torque control loops that are increasingly available on humanoid platforms.

 abstract={Precise kinematic forward models are important for robots to successfully perform dexterous grasping and manipulation tasks, especially when visual servoing is rendered infeasible due to occlusions. A lot of research has been conducted to estimate geometric and non-geometric parameters of kinematic chains to minimize reconstruction errors. However, kinematic chains can include non-linearities, e.g. due to cable stretch and motor-side encoders, that result in significantly different errors for different parts of the state space. Previous work either does not consider such non-linearities or proposes to estimate non-geometric parameters of carefully engineered models that are robot specific. We propose a data-driven approach that learns task error models that account for such unmodeled non-linearities. We argue that in the context of grasping and manipulation, it is sufficient to achieve high accuracy in the task relevant state space. We identify this relevant state space using previously executed joint configurations and learn error corrections for those. Therefore, our system is developed to generate subsequent executions that are similar to previous ones. The experiments show that our method successfully captures the non-linearities in the head kinematic chain (due to a counterbalancing spring) and the arm kinematic chains (due to cable stretch) of the considered experimental platform, see Fig. 1. The feasibility of the presented error learning approach has also been evaluated in independent DARPA ARM-S testing contributing to successfully complete 67 out of 72 grasping and manipulation tasks.},

 abstract={Recently several hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers based on cascades of quadratic programs have been proposed for application on torque controlled robots. They have important theoretical benefits but have never been implemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present an experimental evaluation of these algorithms in the context of balance control for a humanoid robot. The presented experiments demonstrate the applicability of the approach under real robot conditions (i.e. model uncertainty, estimation errors, etc). We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque control loop. We implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows robust performance in face of unknown disturbances, even when the robot is standing on only one foot. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers can be used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot.},

 abstract={Humanoid robots operating in human environments require whole-body controllers that can offer precise tracking and well-defined disturbance rejection behavior. In this contribution, we propose an experimental evaluation of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) using a linearization of the full robot dynamics together with the contact constraints. The advantage of the controller is that it explicitly takes into account the coupling between the different joints to create optimal feedback controllers for whole-body control. We also propose a method to explicitly regulate other tasks of interest, such as the regulation of the center of mass of the robot or its angular momentum. In order to evaluate the performance of linear optimal control designs in a real-world scenario (model uncertainty, sensor noise, imperfect state estimation, etc), we test the controllers in a variety of tracking and balancing experiments on a torque controlled humanoid (e.g. balancing, split plane balancing, squatting, pushes while squatting, and balancing on a wheeled platform). The proposed control framework shows a reliable push recovery behavior competitive with more sophisticated balance controllers, rejecting impulses up to 11.7 Ns with peak forces of 650 N, with the added advantage of great computational simplicity. Furthermore, the controller is able to track squatting trajectories up to 1 Hz without relinearization, suggesting that the linearized dynamics is sufficient for significant ranges of motion.},

 abstract={This paper introduces a framework for state estimation on a humanoid robot platform using only common proprioceptive sensors and knowledge of leg kinematics. The presented approach extends that detailed in prior work on a point-foot quadruped platform by adding the rotational constraints imposed by the humanoid’s flat feet. As in previous work, the proposed Extended Kalman Filter accommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain, making it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. A nonlinear observability analysis is performed on both the point-foot and flat-foot filters and it is concluded that the addition of rotational constraints significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the observability characteristics of the system. Results on a simulated walking dataset demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as well as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis.},

 DOI={10.1109/IROS.2014.6942539}, 
 abstract={Efficient manipulation requires contact to reduce uncertainty. The manipulation literature refers to this as funneling: a methodology for increasing reliability and robustness by leveraging haptic feedback and control of environmental interaction. However, there is a fundamental gap between traditional approaches to trajectory optimization and this concept of robustness by funneling: traditional trajectory optimizers do not discover force feedback strategies. From a POMDP perspective, these behaviors could be regarded as explicit observation actions planned to sufficiently reduce uncertainty thereby enabling a task. While we are sympathetic to the full POMDP view, solving full continuous-space POMDPs in high-dimensions is hard. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which trajectory optimization objectives are augmented with new terms that reward uncertainty reduction through contacts, explicitly promoting funneling. This augmentation shifts the responsibility of robustness toward the actual execution of the optimized trajectories. Directly tracing trajectories through configuration space would lose all robustness-dual execution achieves robustness by devising force controllers to reproduce the temporal interaction profile encoded in the dual solution of the optimization problem. This work introduces dual execution in depth and analyze its performance through robustness experiments in both simulation and on a real-world robotic platform.},

 abstract={The ability to grasp unknown objects still remains an unsolved problem in the robotics community. One of the challenges is to choose an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e., the 6D pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that is based on the assumption that similarly shaped objects can be grasped in a similar way. It is able to synthesize good grasp poses for unknown objects by finding the best matching object shape templates associated with previously demonstrated grasps. The grasp selection algorithm is able to improve over time by using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates to new situations. We tested our approach on two different platforms, the Willow Garage PR2 and the Barrett WAM robot, which have very different hand kinematics. Furthermore, we compared our algorithm with other grasp planners and demonstrated its superior performance. The results presented in this paper show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of unknown objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does improve its performance over time.},

 abstract={Simplified models of the dynamics such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) have proven to perform well for biped walking on flat ground. However, for more complex tasks the assumptions of these models can become limiting. For example, the LIPM does not allow for the control of contact forces independently, is limited to co-planar contacts and assumes that the angular momentum is zero. In this paper, we propose to use the full momentum equations of a humanoid robot in a trajectory optimization framework to plan its center of mass, linear and angular momentum trajectories. The model also allows for planning desired contact forces for each end-effector in arbitrary contact locations. We extend our previous results on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design for momentum control by computing the (linearized) optimal momentum feedback law in a receding horizon fashion. The resulting desired momentum and the associated feedback law are then used in a hierarchical whole body control approach. Simulation experiments show that the approach is computationally fast and is able to generate plans for locomotion on complex terrains while demonstrating good tracking performance for the full humanoid control.},

We investigate how crawling human infants compare to other quadruped mammals, especially primates. We present quantitative data on both the gait and kinematics of seven 10-month-old crawling infants. Body movements were measured with an optoelectronic system giving precise data on 3-dimensional limb movements. Crawling on hands and knees is very similar to the locomotion of non-human primates in terms of the quite protracted arm at touch-down, the coordination between the spine movements in the lateral plane and the limbs, the relatively extended limbs during locomotion and the strong correlation between stance duration and speed of locomotion. However, there are important differences compared to primates, such as the choice of a lateral-sequence walking gait, which is similar to most non-primate mammals and the relatively stiff elbows during stance as opposed to the quite compliant gaits of primates. These finding raise the question of the role of both the mechanical structure of the body and neural control on the determination of these characteristics.},

the effects of also considering noise in the measurement model, by devel-

dynamics of an observer in such a way that the control law explicitly de-
pends on the current measurement uncertainty. In simulation results on a

process noise that creates stiff behaviors. This suggests that taking into account measurement uncertainty could be a potentially very interesting
way to approach problems involving uncertain contact interactions.},

The resulting joint velocities are subject to less noise and delay than filtered velocities computed from numerical differentiation of joint potentiometer signals, leading to superior performance in joint feedback control as demonstrated in experiments performed on a SARCOS hydraulic humanoid.},

 abstract={Optimal control approaches in combination with trajectory optimization have recently proven to be a promising control strategy for legged robots. Computationally efficient and robust algorithms were derived using simplified models of the contact interaction between robot and environment such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM). However, as humanoid robots enter more complex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As we leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that can compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the whole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and interaction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The motion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing force and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum computation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a dedicated solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our motion generation algorithm computes consistent contact forces and joint trajectories for our humanoid robot. We also demonstrate the favorable time complexity due to our formulation and composition of the momentum equations.},

 DOI={10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803251}, 
 abstract={Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve robustness in gaits. However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control strategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach, step location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current state of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a previewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the start of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step duration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the best landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In this stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset between the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the swing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each control cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different scenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed approach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed.},

We present extensive experimental results on a hydraulic, torque controlled humanoid performing balancing and stepping tasks. This feedback control approach captures the necessary synergies between the DoFs of the robot to guarantee good control performance. We show that for the considered tasks, it is only necessary to re-linearize the dynamics of the robot at different contact configurations and that increasing the number of LQR controllers along desired trajectories does not improve performance. Our result suggest that very simple controllers can yield good performance competitive with current state of the art, but more complex, optimization-based whole-body controllers.

 abstract={Linear models for control and motion generation of humanoid robots have received significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well known theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational advantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex; however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be very efficiently optimized and is useful for multi-contact planning. This convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contact locations using a mixed integer program, which can also be efficiently solved. This becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot.},

Unfortunately, the robotics community has stayed out of the debate, for the most part, despite being the main provider of autonomous technologies. In this column, we review the main issues raised by the increase of autonomy in weapon systems and the state of the international discussion. We argue that the robotics community has a fundamental role to play in these discussions, for its own sake, to provide the often-missing technical expertise necessary to frame the debate and promote technological development in line with the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) objective of advancing technology to benefit humanity.},

 DOI={10.1109/ICRA.2018.8461236}, 
 abstract={In this work, we present an extension to a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that plans external contact forces for the robot when given multiple contact locations and their corresponding friction cone. To this end, we set up a two-step optimization problem. In the first optimization, we compute the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory, foot step locations, and introduce slack variables to account for violating the imposed constraints on the Zero Moment Point (ZMP). We then use the slack variables to trigger the second optimization, in which we calculate the optimal external force that compensates for the ZMP tracking error. This optimization considers multiple contacts positions within the environment by formulating the problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that can be solved at a speed between 100-300 Hz. Once contact is created, the MIQP reduces to a single Quadratic Program (QP) that can be solved in real-time (<; 1kHz). Simulations show that the presented walking control scheme can withstand disturbances 2-3× larger with the additional force provided by a hand contact.},

 DOI={10.1109/ICRA.2018.8460537}, 
 abstract={Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in multi-contact scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with fixed timing † †Implementation details and demos can be found in the source code available at https://git-amd.tuebingen.mpg.de/bponton/timeoptimization.},

 abstract={This work presents a method for contact state estimation using fuzzy clustering to learn contact probability for full, six-dimensional humanoid contacts. The data required for training is solely from proprioceptive sensors - endeffector contact wrench sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) - and the method is completely unsupervised. The resulting cluster means are used to efficiently compute the probability of contact in each of the six endeffector degrees of freedom (DoFs) independently. This clustering-based contact probability estimator is validated in a kinematics-based base state estimator in a simulation environment with realistic added sensor noise for locomotion over rough, low-friction terrain on which the robot is subject to foot slip and rotation. The proposed base state estimator which utilizes these six DoF contact probability estimates is shown to perform considerably better than that which determines kinematic contact constraints purely based on measured normal force.},

 abstract={Motion capture is often retargeted to new, and sometimes drastically different, characters. When the characters take on realistic human shapes, however, we become more sensitive to the motion looking right. This means adapting it to be consistent with the physical constraints imposed by different body shapes. We show how to take realistic 3D human shapes, approximate them using a simplified representation, and animate them so that they move realistically using physically-based retargeting. We develop a novel spacetime optimization approach that learns and robustly adapts physical controllers to new bodies and constraints. The approach automatically adapts the motion of the mocap subject to the body shape of a target subject. This motion respects the physical properties of the new body and every body shape results in a different and appropriate movement. This makes it easy to create a varied set of motions from a single mocap sequence by simply varying the characters. In an interactive environment, successful retargeting requires adapting the motion to unexpected external forces. We achieve robustness to such forces using a novel LQR-tree formulation. We show that the simulated motions look appropriate to each character’s anatomy and their actions are robust to perturbations.},

Using a new neural network architecture, we are able to preserve more information from the local policy and make its output interpretable in the sense that its output in terms of desired trajectories, feedforward commands and gains can be interpreted. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the approach to changing environments, outper- forming a model-free gradient policy based methods on the same tasks in simulation.

 DOI={10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2018.8624970}, 
 abstract={In task-based inverse dynamics control, reference accelerations used to follow a desired plan can be broken down into feedforward and feedback trajectories. The feedback term accounts for tracking errors that are caused from inaccurate dynamic models or external disturbances. On underactuated, free-floating robots, such as humanoids, high feedback terms can be used to improve tracking accuracy; however, this can lead to very stiff behavior or poor tracking accuracy due to limited control bandwidth. In this paper, we show how to reduce the required contribution of the feedback controller by incorporating learned task-space reference accelerations. Thus, we i) improve the execution of the given specific task, and ii) offer the means to reduce feedback gains, providing for greater compliance of the system. With a systematic approach we also reduce heuristic tuning of the model parameters and feedback gains, often present in real-world experiments. In contrast to learning task-specific joint-torques, which might produce a similar effect but can lead to poor generalization, our approach directly learns the task-space dynamics of the center of mass of a humanoid robot. Simulated and real-world results on the lower part of the Sarcos Hermes humanoid robot demonstrate the applicability of the approach.},

 DOI={10.1109/ICRA.2019.8794032}, 
 abstract={Humanoid robots dynamically navigate an environment by interacting with it via contact wrenches exerted at intermittent contact poses. Therefore, it is important to consider dynamics when planning a contact sequence. Traditional contact planning approaches assume a quasi-static balance criterion to reduce the computational challenges of selecting a contact sequence over a rough terrain. This however limits the applicability of the approach when dynamic motions are required, such as when walking down a steep slope or crossing a wide gap. Recent methods overcome this limitation with the help of efficient mixed integer convex programming solvers capable of synthesizing dynamic contact sequences. Nevertheless, its exponential-time complexity limits its applicability to short time horizon contact sequences within small environments. In this paper, we go beyond current approaches by learning a prediction of the dynamic evolution of the robot centroidal momenta, which can then be used for quickly generating dynamically robust contact sequences for robots with arms and legs using a search-based contact planner. We demonstrate the efficiency and quality of the results of the proposed approach in a set of dynamically challenging scenarios.},

 abstract={Grasping objects under uncertainty remains an open problem in robotics research. This uncertainty is often due to noisy or partial observations of the object pose or shape. To enable a robot to react appropriately to unforeseen effects, it is crucial that it continuously takes sensor feedback into account. While visual feedback is important for inferring a grasp pose and reaching for an object, contact feedback offers valuable information during manipulation and grasp acquisition. In this paper, we use model-free deep reinforcement learning to synthesize control policies that exploit contact sensing to generate robust grasping under uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach on a multi-fingered hand that exhibits more complex finger coordination than the commonly used two-fingered grippers. We conduct extensive experiments in order to assess the performance of the learned policies, with and without contact sensing. While it is possible to learn grasping policies without contact sensing, our results suggest that contact feedback allows for a significant improvement of grasping robustness under object pose uncertainty and for objects with a complex shape.},

The goal of Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) is to analyze an observed behavior which is assumed to be optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and infer this cost function. Here we develop a method for characterizing cost functions of legged locomotion, with the goal of representing complex humanoid behavior with simple models. To test this methodology we simulate walking gaits of a simple 5 link planar walking model which optimize known cost functions, and assess the ability of our IOC method to recover them. In particular, the IOC method uses an iterative trajectory optimization process to infer cost function weightings consistent with those used to generate a single demonstrated optimal trial. We also explore sensitivity of the IOC to sensor noise in the observed trajectory, imperfect knowledge of the model or task, as well as uncertainty in the components of the cost function used. With appropriate modeling, these methods may help infer cost functions from human data, yielding a compact and generalizable representation of human-like motion for use in humanoid robot controllers, as well as providing a new tool for experimentally exploring human preferences.},

 abstract={Birch tar production by Neanderthals—used for hafting tools—has been interpreted as one of the earliest manifestations of modern cultural behavior. This is because birch tar production per se was assumed to require a cognitively demanding setup, in which birch bark is heated in anaerobic conditions, a setup whose inherent complexity was thought to require modern levels of cognition and cultural transmission. Here we demonstrate that recognizable amounts of birch tar were likely a relatively frequent byproduct of burning birch bark (a natural tinder) under common, i.e., aerobic, conditions. We show that when birch bark burns close to a vertical to subvertical hard surface, such as an adjacent stone, birch tar is naturally deposited and can be easily scraped off the surface. The burning of birch bark near suitable surfaces provides useable quantities of birch tar in a single work session (3 h; including birch bark procurement). Chemical analysis of the resulting tar showed typical markers present in archaeological tar. Mechanical tests verify the tar’s suitability for hafting and for hafted tools use. Given that similarly sized stones as in our experiment are frequently found in archaeological contexts associated with Neanderthals, the cognitively undemanding connection between burning birch bark and the production of birch tar would have been readily discoverable multiple times. Thus, the presence of birch tar alone cannot indicate the presence of modern cognition and/or cultural behaviors in Neanderthals.},

 abstract={Trajectory optimization (TO) is one of the most powerful tools for generating feasible motions for humanoid robots. However, including uncertainties and stochasticity in the TO problem to generate robust motions can easily lead to intractable problems. Furthermore, since the models used in TO have always some level of abstraction, it can be hard to find a realistic set of uncertainties in the model space. In this paper we leverage a sample-efficient learning technique (Bayesian optimization) to robustify TO for humanoid locomotion. The main idea is to use data from full-body simulations to make the TO stage robust by tuning the cost weights. To this end, we split the TO problem into two phases. The first phase solves a convex optimization problem for generating center of mass (CoM) trajectories based on simplified linear dynamics. The second stage employs iterative Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) as a whole-body controller to generate full body control inputs. Then we use Bayesian optimization to find the cost weights to use in the first stage that yields robust performance in the simulation/experiment, in the presence of different disturbance/uncertainties. The results show that the proposed approach is able to generate robust motions for different sets of disturbances and uncertainties.},

During trajectory optimization the curious iLQR attempts to minimize both the task-dependent cost and the uncertainty in the dynamics model. We demonstrate the approach on reaching tasks with 7-DoF manipulators in simulation and on a real robot. Our experiments show that MBRL with curious iLQR reaches desired end-effector targets more reliably and with less system rollouts when learning a new task from scratch, and that the learned model generalizes better to new reaching tasks.},

The approach also enables continuous learning of improved exploration strategies as novel tasks are learned. Extensive simulations on a robot manipulator performing a variety of motion and contact interaction tasks demonstrate the capabilities of the approach. In particular, our experiments suggest that the exploration strategy can more than double learning speed, especially when rewards are sparse.

In this paper, we investigate how the choice of action space can give robust performance in presence of contact uncertainties. We propose learning a policy giving as output impedance and desired position in joint space and compare the performance of that approach to torque and position control under different contact uncertainties. Furthermore, we propose an additional reward term designed to regularize these variable impedance control policies, giving them interpretability and facilitating their transfer to real systems.

We argue that a hindrance is the high cost of experimentation on real systems, in terms of both time and money. We address this problem by proposing an open-source robotic platform which can safely operate without human supervision. The hardware is inexpensive (about SI{5000}[$]{}) yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex interaction with external objects. The software operates at 1-kilohertz and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. The easy-to-use front-end (in C++ and Python) is suitable for real-time control as well as deep reinforcement learning. In addition, the software framework is largely robot-agnostic and can hence be used independently of the hardware proposed herein. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the proposed platform through a number of experiments, including real-time optimal control, deep reinforcement learning from scratch, throwing, and writing.},

 abstract={Step adjustment can improve the gait robustness of biped robots; however, the adaptation of step timing is often ne- glected as it gives rise to nonconvex problems when optimized over several footsteps. In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to optimize walking over several steps to ensure gait viability and show that it is sufficient to merely select the next step timing and location. Using this insight, we propose a novel walking pattern generator that optimally selects step location and timing at every control cycle. Our approach is computationally simple compared to standard approaches in the literature, yet guarantees that any viable state will remain viable in the future. We propose a swing foot adaptation strategy and integrate the pattern generator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control the center of mass nor the foot center of pressure. This is particularly useful for biped robots with limited control authority over their foot center of pressure, such as robots with point feet or passive ankles. Extensive simulations on a humanoid robot with passive ankles demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in various walking situations, including external pushes and foot slippage, and emphasize the importance of step timing adaptation to stabilize walking.},

 DOI={10.1109/LRA.2020.2972825}, 
 abstract={Humanoid robots maintain balance and navigate by controlling the contact wrenches applied to the environment. While it is possible to plan dynamically-feasible motion that applies appropriate wrenches using existing methods, a humanoid may also be affected by external disturbances. Existing systems typically rely on controllers to reactively recover from distur- bances. However, such controllers may fail when the robot cannot reach contacts capable of rejecting a given disturbance. In this paper, we propose a search-based footstep planner which aims to maximize the probability of the robot successfully reaching the goal without falling as a result of a disturbance. The planner considers not only the poses of the planned contact sequence, but also alternative contacts near the planned contact sequence that can be used to recover from external disturbances. Although this additional consideration significantly increases the computation load, we train neural networks to efficiently predict multi-contact zero-step and one-step capturability, which allows the planner to generate robust contact sequences efficiently. Our results show that our approach generates footstep sequences that are more robust to external disturbances than a conventional footstep planner in four challenging scenarios.},

 abstract={In the context of model-based reinforcement learn- ing and control, a large number of methods for learning system dynamics have been proposed in recent years. The purpose of these learned models is to synthesize new control policies. An important open question is how robust current dynamics- learning methods are to shifts in the data distribution due to changes in the control policy. We present a real-robot dataset which allows to systematically investigate this question. This dataset contains trajectories of a 3 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot being controlled by a diverse set of policies. For comparison, we also provide a simulated version of the dataset. Finally, we benchmark a few widely-used dynamics-learning methods using the proposed dataset. Our results show that the iid test error of a learned model is not necessarily a good indicator of its accuracy under control policies different from the one which generated the training data. This suggests that it may be important to evaluate dynamics-learning methods in terms of their transfer performance, rather than only their iid error.},

 abstract={We introduce Crocoddyl (Contact RObot COntrol by Differential DYnamic Library), an open-source framework tailored for efficient multi-contact optimal control. Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. Additionally, we propose a novel optimal control algorithm called Feasibility-driven Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our method does not add extra decision variables which often increases the computation time per iteration due to factorization. FDDP shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms. Con- cretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algo- rithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early “exploratory” iterations (as expected in multiple- shooting methods with only equality constraints). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers (e.g. jumping, front-flip) within few milliseconds.},

 abstract={Real-world applications require light-weight, energy-efficient, fully autonomous robots. Yet, increasing autonomy is oftentimes synonymous with escalating computational requirements. It might thus be desirable to offload intensive computation--not only sensing and planning, but also low-level whole-body control--to remote servers in order to reduce on-board computational needs. Fifth Generation (5G) wireless cellular technology, with its low latency and high bandwidth capabilities, has the potential to unlock cloud-based high performance control of complex robots. However, state-of-the-art control algorithms for legged robots can only tolerate very low control delays, which even ultra-low latency 5G edge computing can sometimes fail to achieve. In this work, we investigate the problem of cloud-based whole-body control of legged robots over a 5G link. We propose a novel approach that consists of a standard optimization-based controller on the network edge and a local linear, approximately optimal controller that significantly reduces on-board computational needs while increasing robustness to delay and possible loss of communication. Simulation experiments on humanoid balancing and walking tasks that includes a realistic 5G communication model demonstrate significant improvement of the reliability of robot locomotion under jitter and delays likely to experienced in 5G wireless links.},

 abstract={Contacts between robots and environment are often assumed to be rigid for control purposes. This assumption can lead to poor performance when contacts are soft and/or underdamped. However, the problem of balancing on soft contacts has not received much attention in the literature. This paper presents two novel approaches to control a legged robot balancing on visco-elastic contacts, and compares them to other two state-of-the-art methods. Our simulation results show that performance heavily depends on the contact stiffness and the noises/uncertainties introduced in the simulation. Briefly, the two novel controllers performed best for soft/medium contacts, whereas &ldquo;inverse-dynamics control under rigid-contact assumptions&rdquo; was the best one for stiff contacts. Admittance control was instead the most robust, but suffered in terms of performance. These results shed light on this challenging problem, while pointing out interesting directions for future investigation.},

 DOI={10.1109/LRA.2021.3057055}, 
 abstract={In the past decade, numerous machine learning algorithms have been shown to successfully learn optimal policies to control real robotic systems. However, it is common to encounter failing behaviors as the learning loop progresses. Specifically, in robot applications where failing is undesired but not catastrophic, many algorithms struggle with leveraging data obtained from failures. This is usually caused by (i) the failed experiment ending prematurely, or (ii) the acquired data being scarce or corrupted. Both complicate the design of proper reward functions to penalize failures. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses those issues. We consider failing behaviors as those that violate a constraint and address the problem of learning with crash constraints, where no data is obtained upon constraint violation. The no-data case is addressed by a novel GP model (GPCR) for the constraint that combines discrete events (failure/success) with continuous observations (only obtained upon success). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on simulated benchmarks and on a real jumping quadruped, where the constraint threshold is unknown a priori. Experimental data is collected, by means of constrained Bayesian optimization, directly on the real robot. Our results outperform manual tuning and GPCR proves useful on estimating the constraint threshold.},

The centroidal dynamics have recently received a large amount of attention in order to create physically realizable motions for robots with hands and feet while being computationally more tractable than full rigid body dynamics models. Our contribution lies in exploiting the structure of the dynamics in order to simplify the original non-convex problem into two convex subproblems. We iterate between these two subproblems for a set number of iterations or until a consensus is reached. We explore the properties of the proposed optimization method for the centroidal dynamics and verify in simulation that motions generated by our approach can be tracked by the quadruped Solo12. In addition, we compare our method to a recently proposed convexification using a sequence of convex relaxations as well as a more standard interior point method used in the off- the-shelf solver IPOPT to show that our approach finds similar, if not better, trajectories (in terms of cost), and is more than four times faster than both approaches. Finally, compared to previous approaches, we note its practicality due to the convex nature of each subproblem which allows our method to be used with any off-the-shelf quadratic programming solver.},

“meta-training” such loss functions, targeted at maximizing the performance of the model trained under them. The loss landscape produced by our learned losses significantly improves upon the original task-specific losses in both supervised and reinforcement learning tasks. Furthermore, we show that our meta-learning framework is flexible enough to incorporate additional informa- tion at meta-train time. This information shapes the learned loss function such that the environment does not need to provide this information during meta-test time.

We posit that well-validated computer simulation can provide a virtual proving ground that in many cases is instrumental in understanding safely, faster, at lower costs, and more thoroughly how the robots of the future should be designed and controlled for safe operation and improved performance. Against this backdrop, we discuss how simulation can help in robotics, barriers that currently prevent its broad adoption, and potential steps that can eliminate some of these barriers. The points and recommendations made concern the following simulation-in-robotics aspects: simulation of the dynamics of the robot; simulation of the virtual world; simulation of the sensing of this virtual world; simulation of the interaction between the human and the robot; and, in less depth, simulation of the communication between robots.

Finally, the approach is embedded in a mixed-integer solver to further find dynamically consistent contact sequences.

The lower level takes into account the swing foot dynamics and generates dynamically consistent trajectories for landing at the desired time as close as possible to the desired location.

 abstract={Learning for model based control can be sampleefﬁcient and generalize well, however successfully learning models and controllers that represent the problem at hand can be challenging for complex tasks. Using inaccurate models for learning can lead to sub-optimal solutions that are unlikely to perform well in practice. In this work, we present a learning approach which iterates between model learning and data collection and leverages forward model prediction error for learning control. We show how using the controller’s prediction as input to a forward model can create a differentiable connection between the controller and the model, allowing us to formulate a loss in the state space. This lets us include forward model prediction error during controller learning and we show that this creates a loss objective that signiﬁcantly improves learning on different motor control tasks. We provide empirical and theoretical results that show the beneﬁts of our method and present evaluations in simulation for learning control on a 7 DoF manipulator and an underactuated 12 DoF quadruped. We show that our approach successfully learns controllers for challenging motor control tasks involving contact switching.},

When physical models are not suﬃciently accurate or hardly describable by analytical formulas, one can use generic function approximators such as neural networks to capture the system dynamics directly from sensor measurements. As for now, current methods to learn the parameters of these neural networks are highly sensitive to the inherent instability of most dynamical systems of interest, which in turn prevents the study of very long sequences. In this work, we introduce a generic and scalable method based on multiple shooting to learn latent representations of indirectly observed dynamical systems. We achieve state-of-the-art performances on systems observed directly from raw images. Further, we demonstrate that our method is robust to noisy measurements and can handle complex dynamical systems, such as chaotic ones.},

In this letter, we propose for the first time to use linear stochastic MPC (SMPC) to account for uncertainties in bipedal walking. We show that SMPC offers more flexibility to the user (or a high level decision maker) by tolerating small (user-defined) probabilities of constraint violation. Therefore, SMPC can be tuned to achieve a constraint satisfaction probability that is arbitrarily close to 100%, but without sacrificing performance as much as tube-based RMPC. We compare SMPC against RMPC in terms of robustness (constraint satisfaction) and performance (optimality).

The approach can efficiently generate optimal state and control trajectories along with local feedback control gains, i.e. impedance schedules. Extensive simulations demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in generating meaningful stiffness and damping modulation patterns before and after contact interaction. For example, contact forces are reduced during early contacts, damping increases to anticipate a high impact event and tracking is automatically traded-off for increased stability.

Efﬁcient interior-point methods have been proposed which leverage the block diagonal structure of the quadratic program (QP) resulting from the receding horizon control formulation. However, they require two matrix factorizations per interior-point method iteration, one each for the computation of the dual and the primal. Recently though an interior point method based on the null-space method has been proposed which requires only a single decomposition per iteration. While the then used nullspace basis leads to dense null-space projections, in this work we propose a sparse null-space basis which preserves the block diagonal structure of the MPC matrices. Since it is based on the inverse of the transfer matrix we introduce the notion of so-called virtual controls which enables just that invertibility. A combination of the reduced number of factorizations and omission of the evaluation of the dual lets our solver outperform others in terms of computational speed by an increasing margin dependent on the number of state and control variables.},

 abstract={Oscillators have two main limitations: their synchronization properties are limited (i.e they have a finite synchronization region) and they have no memory of past interactions (i.e. they return to their intrinsic frequency whenever the entraining signal disappears). We previously proposed a general mechanism to transform an oscillator into an adaptive frequency oscillator which adapts its parameters to learn the frequency of any input signal. The synchronization region then becomes infinite and the oscillator retains the entrainment frequency when the driving signal disappears. While this mechanism has been successfully used in various applications, such as robot control or observer design for active prosthesis, a formal understanding of its properties is still missing. In this paper, we study the adaptation mechanism in the case of strongly coupled phase oscillators and show that non-trivial slow-fast dynamics is at the origin of the adaptation. We show the existence of a layered structure of stable and unstable invariant slow manifolds and demonstrate how the input signal forces the dynamics to jump between these manifolds at regular intervals, leading to exponential convergence of the frequency adaptation. We extend the idea to a network of oscillators with amplitude adaptation and show that the slow invariant manifolds structure persists. Numerical simulations validate our analysis and extend the discussion to more complex cases.},

 abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel framework capable of generating various walking and running gaits for bipedal robots. The main goal is to relax the fixed center of mass (CoM) height assumption of the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) and generate a wider range of walking and running motions, without a considerable increase in complexity. To do so, we use the concept of virtual constraints in the centroidal space which enables generating motions beyond walking while keeping the complexity at a minimum. By a proper choice of these virtual constraints, we show that we can generate different types of walking and running motions. More importantly, enforcing the virtual constraints through feedback renders the dynamics linear and enables us to design a feedback control mechanism which adapts the next step location and timing in face of disturbances, through a simple quadratic program (QP). To show the effectiveness of this framework, we showcase different walking and running simulations of the biped robot Bolt in the presence of both environmental uncertainties and external disturbances.},

 abstract={Generation of robust trajectories for legged robots remains a challenging task due to the underlying nonlinear, hybrid and intrinsically unstable dynamics which needs to be stabilized through limited contact forces. Furthermore, disturbances arising from unmodelled contact interactions with the environment and model mismatches can hinder the quality of the planned trajectories leading to unsafe motions. In this work, we propose to use stochastic trajectory optimization for generating robust centroidal momentum trajectories to account for additive uncertainties on the model dynamics and parametric uncertainties on contact locations. Through an alternation between the robust centroidal and whole-body trajectory optimizations, we generate robust momentum trajectories while being consistent with the whole-body dynamics. We perform an extensive set of simulations subject to diﬀerent uncertainties on a quadruped robot showing that our stochastic trajectory optimization problem reduces the amount of foot slippage for diﬀerent gaits while achieving better performance over deterministic planning.},

Moreover, an approximation for the expectation of the general nonlinear cost is proposed to enable an iterative line search solution to the planning problem. The optimal estimator is also derived along with the controls minimizing the general stochastic nonlinear cost. Finally extensive simulations are carried out to show the increased robustness the proposed framework provides when compared to the risk neutral iLQG counter part.

The algorithm consists of an iterative procedure combining a backward recursion similar to minimax differential dynamic programming and a forward recursion resembling a risksensitive Kalman smoother. A coupling equation renders the resulting control dependent on the estimation. In the end, the algorithm is equivalent to a Newton step but has linear complexity in the time horizon length. Furthermore, a merit function and a line search procedure are introduced to guarantee convergence of the iterative scheme. The resulting controller reasons about uncertainty by planning for the worst case disturbances. Lastly, the low computational cost of the proposed algorithm makes it a promising method to do output-feedback model predictive control on complex systems at high frequency.

 DOI={10.1109/Humanoids53995.2022.10000208}, 
 abstract={Contact dynamics relies on the simultaneous satisfaction of constraints at the robot body level and at the contact level. At both levels, various formulations can be chosen that all must lead to the same results, given the same hypothesis, hence the little importance of their details. Yet when using it in an optimal control problem, a particular formulation is often imposed by the task to be performed by the robot. In this paper, we detail the formulation of the contact quantities (force, movement) in an arbitrary frame imposed by the task. In that case, we will show that we are typically not interested in working in the local frame (attached to the robot contact point), nor in the world frame, but in a user-defined frame centered at the contact location with a fixed orientation in the world. The derivations can then be used for 6D, 3D or normal (pure-sliding) contact. We implemented the corresponding derivatives on top of the contact dynamics of Pinocchio in the optimal control solver Crocoddyl. In order to show that a unique formulation is able to handle several operational orientations, we achieved several surfacing tasks in model predictive control with the robot Talos.},

 abstract={Model predictive control (MPC) has shown great success for controlling complex systems, such as legged robots. However, when closing the loop, the performance and feasibility of the finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP) solved at each control cycle are not guaranteed anymore. This is due to model discrepancies, the effect of low-level controllers, uncertainties, and sensor noise. To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC approach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance) guarantees. In this approach, instead of adding a (conservative) terminal constraint to the problem, we propose to use the measured state projected to the viability kernel in the OCP solved at each control cycle. Moreover, we use past experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a combination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability (invariance). These interpretable costs measure the tradeoff between robustness and performance. For this purpose, we use Bayesian optimization to systematically design experiments that help efficiently collect data to learn a cost function leading to robust performance. Our simulation results with different realistic disturbances (i.e., external pushes, unmodeled actuator dynamics, and computational delay) show the effectiveness of our approach to create robust controllers for humanoid robots.},

 abstract={The millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have attracted considerable attention for high precision localization applications due to the ability to capture high angular and temporal resolution measurements. This paper explores mmWave-based positioning for a target localization problem where a fixed target broadcasts mmWave signals and a mobile robotic agent attempts to capture the signals to locate and navigate to the target. A three-stage procedure is proposed: First, the mobile agent uses tensor decomposition methods to detect the multipath channel components and estimate their parameters. Second, a machine-learning trained classifier is then used to predict the link state, meaning if the strongest path is line-of-sight (LOS) or non-LOS (NLOS). For the NLOS case, the link state predictor also determines if the strongest path arrived via one or more reflections. Third, based on the link state, the agent either follows the estimated angles or uses computer vision or other sensor to explore and map the environment. The method is demonstrated on a large dataset of indoor environments supplemented with ray tracing to simulate the wireless propagation. The path estimation and link state classification are also integrated into a state-of-the-art neural simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) module to augment camera and LIDAR-based navigation. It is shown that the link state classifier can successfully generalize to completely new environments outside the training set. In addition, the neural-SLAM module with the wireless path estimation and link state classifier provides rapid navigation to the target, close to a baseline that knows the target location.},

However, learning representations that generalize quickly to new scenarios is still an open research problem in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present a framework to metalearn the critic for gradient-based policy learning. Concretely, we propose a model-based bi-level optimization algorithm that updates the critics parameters such that the policy that is learned with the updated critic gets closer to solving the metatraining tasks. We illustrate that our algorithm leads to learned critics that resemble the ground truth Q function for a given task. Finally, after meta-training, the learned critic can be used to learn new policies for new unseen task and environment settings via model-free policy gradient optimization, without requiring a model. We present results that show the generalization capabilities of our learned critic to new tasks and dynamics when used to learn a new policy in a new scenario.},

Hard frictional contacts are particularly troublesome to simulate because they make differential equations stiff, calling for computationally demanding implicit integration schemes. We suggest to tackle this issue by using exponential integrators, a long-standing class of integration schemes (first introduced in the 1960s) that in recent years has enjoyed a resurgence of interest. This scheme can be applied to multibody systems subject to stiff viscoelastic contacts, leading to integration errors similar to implicit Euler, but at much lower computational costs (between 2 to 100 times faster). In our tests with quadruped and biped robots, our method demonstrated a stable behavior with large time steps (10 ms) and stiff contacts (105 N/m). Its excellent properties, especially for fast and coarse simulations, make it a valuable candidate for many applications in robotics, such as simulation, model predictive control, reinforcement learning, and controller design.},

Following previous approaches in force control, we then propose to augment the classical formulations with a model of the robot actuation, which naturally allows to generate online trajectories that adapt to sensed position, velocity and torques. We propose a complete implementation of this idea on the upper part of a real humanoid robot, and show through hardware experiments that this new formulation incorporating effort feedback outperforms classical MPC in challenging tasks where physical interaction with the environment is crucial.},

 abstract={Implementing dynamic locomotion behaviors on legged robots requires a high-quality state estimation module. Especially when the motion includes ﬂight phases, state-of-theart approaches fail to produce reliable estimation of the robot posture, in particular base height. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for combining visual-inertial odometry (VIO) with leg odometry in an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) based state estimator. The VIO module uses a stereo camera and IMU to yield low-drift 3D position and yaw orientation and drift-free pitch and roll orientation of the robot base link in the inertial frame. However, these values have a considerable amount of latency due to image processing and optimization, while the rate of update is quite low which is not suitable for low-level control. To reduce the latency, we predict the VIO state estimate at the rate of the IMU measurements of the VIO sensor. The EKF module uses the base pose and linear velocity predicted by VIO, fuses them further with a second high-rate IMU and leg odometry measurements, and produces robot state estimates with a high frequency and small latency suitable for control. We integrate this lightweight estimation framework with a nonlinear model predictive controller and show successful implementation of a set of agile locomotion behaviors, including trotting and jumping at varying horizontal speeds, on a torque-controlled quadruped robot.},

To do so, we project the whole-body dynamics of a legged robot into the nullspace of the contact constraints, allowing expression of the dynamics independent of the contact forces. Using the constrained dynamics and the centroidal momentum matrix, we are able to directly relate joint torques and centroidal states dynamics. Using the resulting model as the process model of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), we fuse the torque measurement in the centroidal state estimation problem.

 abstract={Model predictive control is a powerful tool to generate complex motions for robots. However, it often requires solving non-convex problems online to produce rich behaviors, which is computationally expensive and not always practical in real time. Additionally, direct integration of high dimensional sensor data (e.g. RGB-D images) in the feedback loop is challenging with current state-space methods. This paper aims to address both issues. It introduces a model predictive control scheme, where a neural network constantly updates the cost function of a quadratic program based on sensory inputs, aiming to minimize a general non-convex task loss without solving a non-convex problem online. By updating the cost, the robot is able to adapt to changes in the environment directly from sensor measurement without requiring a new cost design. Furthermore, since the quadratic program can be solved efﬁciently with hard constraints, a safe deployment on the robot is ensured. Experiments with a wide variety of reaching tasks on an industrial robot manipulator demonstrate that our method can efﬁciently solve complex non-convex problems with highdimensional visual sensory inputs, while still being robust to external disturbances.},

 title={Path Planning Under Uncertainty to Localize mmWave Sources}, 
 url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03739}, 
 abstract={In this paper, we study a navigation problem where a mobile robot needs to locate a mmWave wireless signal. Using the directionality properties of the signal, we propose an estimation and path planning algorithm that can efﬁciently navigate in cluttered indoor environments. We formulate Extended Kalman ﬁlters for emitter location estimation in cases where the signal is received in line-of-sight or after reﬂections. We then propose to plan motion trajectories based on belief-space dynamics in order to minimize the uncertainty of the position estimates. The associated non-linear optimization problem is solved by a state-of-the-art constrained iLQR solver. In particular, we propose a method that can handle a large number of obstacles (∼ 300) with reasonable computation times. We validate the approach in an extensive set of simulations. We show that our estimators can help increase navigation success rate and that planning to reduce estimation uncertainty can improve the overall task completion speed.},

 title={Risk-Sensitive Extended Kalman Filter}, 
 url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11573}, 
 abstract={In robotics, designing robust algorithms in the face of estimation uncertainty is a challenging task. Indeed, controllers often do not consider the estimation uncertainty and only rely on the most likely estimated state. Consequently, sudden changes in the environment or the robot’s dynamics can lead to catastrophic behaviors. In this work, we present a risk-sensitive Extended Kalman Filter that allows doing outputfeedback Model Predictive Control (MPC) safely. This ﬁlter adapts its estimation to the control objective. By taking a pessimistic estimate concerning the value function resulting from the MPC controller, the ﬁlter provides increased robustness to the controller in phases of uncertainty as compared to a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Moreover, the ﬁlter has the same complexity as an EKF, so that it can be used for real-time model-predictive control. The paper evaluates the risk-sensitive behavior of the proposed ﬁlter when used in a nonlinear model-predictive control loop on a planar drone and industrial manipulator in simulation, as well as on an external force estimation task on a real quadruped robot. These experiments demonstrate the abilities of the approach to improve performance in the face of uncertainties signiﬁcantly.},

 title={NIPM-HLSP: An Efficient Interior-Point Method for Hierarchical Least-Squares Programs}, 
 url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13602}, 
 DOI={10.1007/s11081-023-09823-x}, 
 abstract={Hierarchical least-squares programs with linear constraints (HLSP) are a type of optimization problem very common in robotics. Each priority level contains an objective in leastsquares form which is subject to the linear constraints of the higher priority hierarchy levels. Active-set methods (ASM) are a popular choice for solving them. However, they can perform poorly in terms of computational time if there are large changes of the active set. We therefore propose a computationally efﬁcient primal-dual interior-point method (IPM) for HLSP’s which is able to maintain constant numbers of solver iterations in these situations. We base our IPM on the null-space method which requires only a single decomposition per Newton iteration instead of two as it is the case for other IPM solvers. After a priority level has converged we compose a set of active constraints judging upon the dual and project lower priority levels into their null-space. We show that the IPM-HLSP can be expressed in least-squares form which avoids the formation of the quadratic Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Hessian. Due to our choice of the null-space basis the IPM-HLSP is as fast as the state-of-the-art ASM-HLSP solver for equality only problems.},
