	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel two-level variable Horizon Model Predictive Control (VH-MPC) framework for bipedal locomotion. In this framework, the higher level computes the landing location and timing (horizon length) of the swing foot to stabilize the unstable part of the center of mass (CoM) dynamics, using feedback from the CoM states. The lower level takes into account the swing foot dynamics and generates dynamically consistent trajectories for landing at the desired time as close as possible to the desired location. To do that, we use a simplified model of the robot dynamics projected in swing foot space that takes into account joint torque constraints as well as the friction cone constraints of the stance foot. We show the effectiveness of our proposed control framework by implementing robust walking patterns on our torque-controlled and open-source biped robot, Bolt. We report extensive simulations and real robot experiments in the presence of various disturbances and uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical inverse dynamics based on cascades of quadratic programs have been proposed for the control of legged robots. They have important benefits but to the best of our knowledge have never been implemented on a torque controlled humanoid where model inaccuracies, sensor noise and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. Using a reformulation of existing algorithms, we propose a simplification of the problem that allows to achieve real-time control. Momentum-based control is integrated in the task hierarchy and a LQR design approach is used to compute the desired associated closed-loop behavior and improve performance. Extensive experiments on various balancing and tracking tasks show very robust performance in the face of unknown disturbances, even when the humanoid is standing on one foot. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical inverse dynamics together with momentum control can be efficiently used for feedback control under real robot conditions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an architecture for autonomous manipulation. Our approach is based on the belief that contact interactions during manipulation should be exploited to improve dexterity and that optimizing motion plans is useful to create more robust and repeatable manipulation behaviors. We therefore propose an architecture where state of the art force/torque control and optimization-based motion planning are the core components of the system. We give a detailed description of the modules that constitute the complete system and discuss the challenges inherent to creating such a system. We present experimental results for several grasping and manipulation tasks to demonstrate the performance and robustness of our approach.},
