	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of computing optimal impedance schedules for legged locomotion tasks involving complex contact interactions. We formulate the problem of impedance regulation as a trade-off between disturbance rejection and measurement uncertainty. We extend a stochastic optimal control algorithm known as Risk Sensitive Control to take into account measurement uncertainty and propose a formal way to include such uncertainty for unknown contact locations. The approach can efficiently generate optimal state and control trajectories along with local feedback control gains, i.e. impedance schedules. Extensive simulations demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in generating meaningful stiffness and damping modulation patterns before and after contact interaction. For example, contact forces are reduced during early contacts, damping increases to anticipate a high impact event and tracking is automatically traded-off for increased stability. In particular, we show a significant improvement in performance during jumping and trotting tasks with a simulated quadruped robot.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14834},
	abstract = {Reactive stepping and push recovery for biped robots is often restricted to ﬂat terrains because of the difﬁculty in computing capture regions for nonlinear dynamic models. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a novel 3D reactive stepper, the {DeepQ} stepper, that can approximately learn the 3D capture regions of both simpliﬁed and full robot dynamic models using reinforcement learning, which can then be used to ﬁnd optimal steps. The stepper can take into account the entire dynamics of the robot, ignored in most reactive steppers, leading to a signiﬁcant improvement in performance. The {DeepQ} stepper can handle nonconvex terrain with obstacles, walk on restricted surfaces like stepping stones while tracking different velocities, and recover from external disturbances for a constant low computational cost.},

	title = {Leveraging Forward Model Prediction Error for Learning Control},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03859},
	abstract = {Learning for model based control can be sampleefﬁcient and generalize well, however successfully learning models and controllers that represent the problem at hand can be challenging for complex tasks. Using inaccurate models for learning can lead to sub-optimal solutions that are unlikely to perform well in practice. In this work, we present a learning approach which iterates between model learning and data collection and leverages forward model prediction error for learning control. We show how using the controller’s prediction as input to a forward model can create a differentiable connection between the controller and the model, allowing us to formulate a loss in the state space. This lets us include forward model prediction error during controller learning and we show that this creates a loss objective that signiﬁcantly improves learning on different motor control tasks. We provide empirical and theoretical results that show the beneﬁts of our method and present evaluations in simulation for learning control on a 7 {DoF} manipulator and an underactuated 12 {DoF} quadruped. We show that our approach successfully learns controllers for challenging motor control tasks involving contact switching.},
