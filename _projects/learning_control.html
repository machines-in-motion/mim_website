            <p>Robots are increasingly equipped with multiple, redundant, sensing modalities (inertial, force, tactile or visual perception) and it remains a significant challenge to efficiently use this information to create robust behaviors in unknown environments. 
Further, robots are seldom capable of learning new or improving known behaviors as they collect more real-world experience.
To address this challenge, we design learning algorithms capable of using multi-modal sensory data to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>learn dynamic models to anticipate the consequences of robot actions</li>
  <li>learn control policies from simulation, trial and error or human demonstrations</li>
  <li>learn cost and value functions to capture desired goals and behaviors</li>
</ol>

<p>Importantly, we test all of our learning algorithms on real robot for
manipulation and locomotion tasks to ensure that they are robust to real noisy sensors and imperfect actuators.</p>

When physical models are not suﬃciently accurate or hardly describable by analytical formulas, one can use generic function approximators such as neural networks to capture the system dynamics directly from sensor measurements. As for now, current methods to learn the parameters of these neural networks are highly sensitive to the inherent instability of most dynamical systems of interest, which in turn prevents the study of very long sequences. In this work, we introduce a generic and scalable method based on multiple shooting to learn latent representations of indirectly observed dynamical systems. We achieve state-of-the-art performances on systems observed directly from raw images. Further, we demonstrate that our method is robust to noisy measurements and can handle complex dynamical systems, such as chaotic ones.">

<!-- 
<p>Modeling dynamical systems plays a crucial role in capturing and understanding complex physical phenomena. When physical models are not suﬃciently accurate or hardly describable by analytical formulas, one can use generic function approximators such as neural networks to capture the system dynamics directly from sensor measurements. As for now, current methods to learn the parameters of these neural networks are highly sensitive to the inherent instability of most dynamical systems of interest, which in turn prevents the study of very long sequences. In this work, we introduce a generic and scalable method based on multiple shooting to learn latent representations of indirectly observed dynamical systems. We achieve state-of-the-art performances on systems observed directly from raw images. Further, we demonstrate that our method is robust to noisy measurements and can handle complex dynamical systems, such as chaotic ones.</p>
