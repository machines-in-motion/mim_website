Cost landscapes in robotic tasks, particularly when dealing with intermittent contacts with the environment, can be highly non-convex. This can make it very difficult to find globally optimal solutions. Developing good exploration strategies is necessary in enabling us to escape sub-optimal local minima. In our group we examine methods for doing this based on leveraging existing knowledge in some robotic domain or using general concepts like curiosity.
