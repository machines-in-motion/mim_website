For robots to be truly useful in human environments, they need to be able to grap and manipulate objects and even use tools. Ideally, they should be able to handle
new objects, new tools and be able to quickly learn new manipulation skills
when necessary, either through human demonstration or through trial and error.
Towards this goal, we design control, planning, perception and learning algorithms toward this goal.
We further build complete manipulation systems capable of robustly achieving complex manipulation tasks.
