State estimation and perception are important when we try to make sense of what is 
happening in the world. Through perception and state estimation we are not only able to get a better understanding of what surrounds the robot in its environment but also about the current state of the robot in the environment. This will eventually enable the robot to perform interesting tasks such as manipulation or locomotion.
