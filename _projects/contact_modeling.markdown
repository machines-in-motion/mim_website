Contact interactions involve complicated phenomena such as friction, unilaterality of the forces, and hard impacts. Such phenomena introduce discontinuities to the dynamics in both the locomotion and manipulation problems. A deep understanding of the underlying mechanics provides insights that assist in simulating robots and designing better estimation and control algorithms.
