Regulating physical interaction is a complex problem, especially when intermittent contacts are made. To simplify the problem, efficient algorithms are often built upon assumptions that are reductive of the physical world. When such algorithms are deployed on robots, they may lead to poor task execution or even put human lives in danger. To address this issue, we develop various techniques that robustify these algorithms in the presence of uncertainties incurred by our inability to model the world perfectly.
