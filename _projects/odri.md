The Open Dynamic Robot Initiative (ODRI) is a multi-institutional collaboration about building open-source dynamic robot platforms at low cost. The low cost is achieved by using 3D printing techniques and off-the-shelf components. Multiple robots have been developed including manipulator platforms, quadrupeds and a biped. The instructions for buildings the robots can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware/) and a [forum](https://odri.discourse.group/) is used to answer questions.
