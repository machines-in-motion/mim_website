            <p>Dynamic interaction of robotic systems, humans and animals with their environment
through the creation of intermittent physical contacts is at the heart of any locomotion or manipulation behavior. Yet, the generation of robust behaviors with intermittent contacts in a dynamically changing unknown environment remains a fundamental challenge for robotics research. 
We argue that our current inability to plan and control behaviors with
contacts that are robust to external disturbances and environmental uncertainty constitute a major inhibitor to the deployment of robotics in unknown environments.</p>

<p>In this line of research, we investigates algorithms that explicitly
take into account uncertainty stemming from unmodeled dynamics or
measurement noise. In particular, we design numerically efficient algorithms
for output feedback risk-sensitive optimal control and stochastic model-predictive control. We apply these ideas to the computation of optimal movements and impedance profiles that are robust to physical interactions.</p>

<p>This paper addresses the problem of computing optimal impedance schedules for legged locomotion tasks involving complex contact interactions. We formulate the problem of impedance regulation as a trade-off between disturbance rejection and measurement uncertainty. We extend a stochastic optimal control algorithm known as Risk Sensitive Control to take into account measurement uncertainty and propose a formal way to include such uncertainty for unknown contact locations. The approach can efficiently generate optimal state and control trajectories along with local feedback control gains, i.e. impedance schedules. Extensive simulations demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in generating meaningful stiffness and damping modulation patterns before and after contact interaction. For example, contact forces are reduced during early contacts, damping increases to anticipate a high impact event and tracking is automatically traded-off for increased stability. In particular, we show a significant improvement in performance during jumping and trotting tasks with a simulated quadruped robot.</p>
