Wireless communication based on fifth generation (5G) technology offers unprecedented opportu- nities for the deployment of mobile robots in industry and consumer environments as it promises to both high data bandwidth and low latency communication. High bandwidth and low latency in turn enable mobile robots to remotely execute computationally demanding perception, planning and control algorithms instead of executing them locally. In particular, the low-latency guarantees of 5G wireless can potentially be leveraged to offload even fast millisecond-scale force and torque control loops to the edge. At the same time, the rich multi-modal sensor data that mobile robots use for visual perception can be transmitted over high data-rate 5G links. Finally, 5G enables high-throughput robot-to-robot communication, enabling complex interactions between teams of robots. Together, these new capabilities can enable mobile robots with improved autonomy, range, form-factor, cost and reliability.

In this line of research, in collaboration wireless and low-power computing experts Profs. <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/elza-erkip">E. Erkip</a>, <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg">S. Garg</a>, and <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/sundeep-rangan">S. Rangan</a>,
we investigate how 5G wireless can benefit robotics.
