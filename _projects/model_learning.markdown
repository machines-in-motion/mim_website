Model learning and system identification play a fundamental role in our understanding of the interactions between a robot and its environment: a model gives the ability to forecast the future, perform planning and implement control algorithms. In our group, we aim to develop techniques for learning and identifying complex dynamics models (nonsmooth, unstable, hybrid...) that can efficiently be used with optimal control and reinforcement learning algorithms.
