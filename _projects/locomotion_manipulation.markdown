We are interested in evaluating our algorithms on real robots, especially in contact-rich tasks such as object manipulation and dynamic locomotion, for example, dynamic walking, jumping, and in-hand manipulation. In our lab, we build complete systems consisting of low-level control, perception, and planning to demonstrate these capabilities on high-performance torque-controlled robots. Apart from commercial robots, such as the Sarcos humanoid robot Hermes and Kuka arms, we initiated the Open Dynamics Robot Initiative (ODRI) through which we developed affordable open-source legged locomotion and manipulation systems suitable for research and education.
