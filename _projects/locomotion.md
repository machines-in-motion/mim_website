We are fascinated by movements, especially locomotion behaviors. Beyond this interest, robots with legs open a wide range of potential applications as they
can move on complicated environments, whether with clutter, obstacles or holes.
A major axis of research in our laboratory is concerned with the design
of general purpose algorithms to endow robots with any number of legs with
the ability to walk, run, jump and climb across any type of unknown terrains.
