Cost functions afford to efficiently encode desired behaviors and transfer them across robots. They are also capable of capturing human preferences for certain types of movements. We use inverse optimal control and inverse reinforcement learning techniques to automatically acquire cost functions, using examples from human demonstrations or from robots with different morphologies performing various tasks. Beyond skill acquisition in robotics, we also aim to use these algorithms to inform human movement studies.
