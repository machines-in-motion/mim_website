## K-12 Education

We participate in several programs in K-12 STEM education at NYU. This includes
the [Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE)](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/k12-stem-education/arise) program, which
offers laboratory research experience over the summer for high-school students living in New York City.
We also co-created the summer NYU K-12 [Machine Learning summer program](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/k12-stem-education/machine-learning-ml)
and coordinated its organization between 2019 and 2022.
