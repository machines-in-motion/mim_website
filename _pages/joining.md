## students

- **If you are a NYU student,** feel free to contact directly Ludovic Righetti. Check out our research, read our papers or take our classes first!

- **If you are a prospective NYU graduate student.** Please apply to the ECE or MAE graduate schools first. We cannot accept students prior their acceptance to NYUâ€™s graduate school. Feel free to contact Ludovic Righetti to discuss potential opportunities AFTER you have applied to the graduate school!

- **If you are a non-NYU student,** unfortunately we do not usually offer internships to non-NYU students unless there is a strong connection to our research interests and the visiting student can stay longer than 4 months at NYU. If you believe you fit in this category, feel free to contact Ludovic Righetti.

**In every case, please include in your email (as pdf) 1) a CV, 2) an unofficial transcript and 3) a short description of your research interests and how they relate to our research. Any unsolicited application that does not contain three distinct pdf files with the requested documents will not receive an answer.**

## postdocs
We are always excited to welcome motivated scientists in our team (if funding allows). If you are interested in doing a postdoc in our laboratory, feel free to contact Ludovic Righetti directly. Please include a complete CV, a research statement describing your interests, goals and how they related to our research, a complete list of publications, copies of up to three relevant scientific papers, and the names and contact information of three references (all as pdf).
