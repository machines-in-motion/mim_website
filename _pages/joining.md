Note that we unfortunately receive too many unsolicited requests and we
are not able to answer all of them. We apologize if we did not answer
your email.


### Students

* <b>If you are a NYU student</b>, feel free to contact us directly. Check out our research, read our papers or take our classes first!
* <b> If you are a prospective graduate student</b>, please apply to the ECE or MAE graduate schools first. We cannot accept students prior their acceptance to NYUâ€™s graduate school. Feel free to contact us to discuss potential opportunities AFTER you have applied to the graduate school!
* <b>If you are a non-NYU student</b>, unfortunately we do not usually offer internships to non-NYU students unless there is a strong connection to our research interests and you can stay longer than 4 months at NYU. If you believe you fit in this category, feel free to contact us.

In every case, please include in your email (as pdf) 1) a CV, 2) an unofficial transcript and 3) a short description of your research interests and how they relate to our research. 
Any unsolicited application that does not contain three distinct pdf files with the requested documents will likely not receive an answer.

### Postdocs
We are always excited to welcome motivated scientists in our team (if funding allows). If you are interested in doing a postdoc in our laboratory, feel free to contact us directly. Please include a complete CV (with a list of publications), a research statement describing your interests, goals and how they related to our research.
