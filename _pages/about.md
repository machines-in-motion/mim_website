<p>We are the <b>Machines in Motion laboratory</b> and we conduct fundamental and applied research in robotics.
We strive to discover the algorithmic foundations of robotic movements as we believe
that understanding how machines should move and interact with unknown environments is central for creating truly autonomous robots.
In particular, we aim to conceive general methods applicable to any robots with arms and legs endowing them with the ability
to robustly and safely perform any locomotion and manipulation tasks in unknown environments and to constantly improve their performances as they experience the world.
</p>
<p>
The laboratory commits to conducting socially responsible activities and strives to promote applications of robotic technologies that will demonstrably improve quality of life, empower people and generally help create more open and equal societies.
</p>

<p>
Our laboratory was established in September 2017 at New York University's 
<a href="engineering.nyu.edu/">Tandon School of Engineering</a>.
 It also includes the members of the <a href="https://mg.is.mpg.de/">Movement Generation and Control Group</a> (group established in September 2012 by L. Righetti) at the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.
