The Machines in Motion Laboratory was established in September 2017 in New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering and closely collaborates with the [Movement Generation and Control Group](https://mg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) (established in Sept. 2012) at the Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, Germany. Both groups are headed by Prof. [Ludovic Righetti](https://wp.nyu.edu/machinesinmotion/89-2/).
